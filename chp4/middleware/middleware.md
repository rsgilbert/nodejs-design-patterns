# Middleware pattern
Middleware represents a processing pipeline.
The middleware pattern is a pattern where a set of processing units, filters, handlers etc under the form of functions are connected 
to form an asynchronous sequence in order to perform preprocessing and postprocessing of 
any kind of data.

The Middleware Manager, a component of the middleware pattern, 
is responsible for organizing and executing the 
middleware functions.

# Strategy pattern
The strategy pattern enables an object called the context
to support variations in its logic by extracting the 
variable parts into separate interchangeable objects
called strategies.
The context implements the common logic whereas the strategy 
implements the mutable parts allowing the context to change
its behaviour depending on different factors.
